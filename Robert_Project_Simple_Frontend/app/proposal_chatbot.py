            Your primary objective is to carefully analyze both sets of information. Identify the projects from the future project file that align with your company's strengths and expertise. Focus on creating proposals for projects where your company can excel.
            Even in cases where your company may not have prior domain-specific experts, emphasize our adaptability and commitment to finding solutions. Avoid mentioning limitations and instead focus on the positive aspects of our approach that we will use to complete the future project.
            Please structure your response with the following headings and format:
            1) Name of Agency
            2) Name of project 
            3) Mission purpose of Agency.  (What must this agency accomplish for citizens or other stakeholders?)
            4) Mission purpose of project (How does this project help the Agency accomplish its mission?)
            5) Specific result your company could produce for the project (Not an activity description. This should be a particular mission-related result)
            6) Government budget document (indicate allocated budget)
            7) Reason to not worry about incumbent contractor

            8) How might you add value to the upcoming project? What will be your role?
            9) What similar project have you supported in the past where you added value in a similar way?
            10) What smart stuff did you do on that prior project?  (Make a list)
            11) For each of those smart things you did, what would have gone wrong if you had not done them? (List for each smart thing you did.)
            12) What might go wrong in future project if you don't do the same smart stuff? (List for each smart thing you did.)
            13) What mission goal might not be attained in the future project if you don't do your smart stuff? (List for each smart thing you did.)
            14) Formulate a value assertion based on this model:  If the XYZ agency does not use our smart stuff, they risk not attaining Mission Goal A.
            15) Potential problem. What problem might the project have if you are not involved?
            16) New Project Stakeholders. Who are the stakeholders who will depend on the new project results?
            17) New Project Senior Executive officer. Which government executives officer are most reliant on good project results?
            18) New Project Problem Stakeholder Impact. How will stakeholders and senior executives be affected if the problem occurs?
            19) Past Project. In what past project have you solved or prevented a similar problem?
            20) Past Problem. Had the problem occurred, what exactly would have happened?
            21) Past project villain. What caused this problem?
            22) Past Solution. What solution solved or prevented that problem?
            23) Past project senior executive officer. Who was the most senior executive officer who would have been negatively impacted? 
            24) Past project stakeholders. What stakeholders would have been affected by the problem?
            25) Past project complication. What severe complication might this problem have caused for the senior executive?
	    26) Pain Point. Identify the organizational group that will feel pain if the problem you identified occurs. An organizational chart might help you identify that group.
            27) Phone Number. Find a phone number you might call to get connected to the leader of the Pain Point organization.  This could well be the main switchboard for the organization.  The idea is to speak to a live person who will understand the mission problem youâ€™ve identified, and will help you get connected with someone who can solve it.
            28) Phone Script. Draft the words you will say when someone answers the phone.  
            Always provide brief and detailed answers for all of the questions mentioned above. While Providing responses avoid to tell the risks related to the limited resources, resource constraints or anything related to resources and time.
